## 3. Legal Bases for Processing

We process your data for the following reasons:

- **To verify your identity:** We are required by law (UK GDPR Article 6(1)(c)) to check your identity before releasing records.
- **To request and receive your health records:** We rely on your consent (UK GDPR Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(a) for special-category data).
- **To provide you with consolidated records:** We use your consent and the provision of health care as legal bases (UK GDPR Article 6(1)(a) and Article 9(2)(h)).
- **To maintain security and audit trails:** We have a legitimate interest in keeping your data safe and complying with NHS requirements (UK GDPR Article 6(1)(f) and Article 9(2)(h)).
- **To improve our services:** We use anonymised or pseudonymised data where possible, based on our legitimate interests (UK GDPR Article 6(1)(f)).

You can withdraw your consent at any time (see section 7).

## 4. How We Collect and Process Records

- You provide identity documents, contact details, and information about your past healthcare providers and addresses.
- You sign a time-limited authority allowing TRMT to make subject-access requests on your behalf.
- We contact each provider, supplying your ID and requesting copies of any records they hold.
- Providers respond; if data are not already in FHIR format, we convert them to UK FHIR Core R4.
- You review your combined record via our portal or FHIR API and decide whether to share it.
- You remain in control – you may delete individual items or your entire record at any time (see section 6).
- Sometimes, a GP practice or hospital may contact you directly to confirm that you authorised TRMT to act for you. Please reply promptly to avoid delays.

---

## 5. How We Protect Your Information

- All health data are stored only in encrypted UK data centres (NHS-accepted Tier 1 cloud or ISO 27001 on-premises).
- Data in transit are protected by TLS 1.2+; FHIR API access requires OAuth 2.0 with role-based scopes.
- We complete the NHS Data Security & Protection Toolkit every year and appoint a Caldicott Guardian and Data Protection Officer.
- Access logs, anomaly detection, and penetration tests help us detect unauthorised activity.

---

## 6. Retention and Deletion

- **Health records:** Kept until you delete your TRMT account or ask us to delete specific items. You can delete any item or your whole record at any time via the portal.
- **Identity and consent logs:** Kept for six years after your last action (legal limitation period). We cannot shorten this, but they are removed after six years.
- **Web-usage logs:** Kept for 12 months. You can opt out of non-essential cookies (see section 9).

When you delete your record, we erase both primary and backup copies within 14 days and send you confirmation.

---

## 7. Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Access a copy of your data
- Correct inaccurate data
- Delete your data (“right to erasure”)
- Restrict or object to processing
- Receive your data in FHIR bundles (data portability)
- Withdraw consent at any time
- Raise a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) – [ico.org.uk](https://ico.org.uk)

Contact our DPO to exercise any of these rights.

## 8. Sharing Your Information

We only share your data:

- With healthcare providers you nominate (such as your GP, consultant, or a new app) via UK FHIR Core
- With trusted service providers under contract (such as cloud hosting or document-conversion services) who must meet NHS standards
- Where required by law (for example, a court order)

We do not sell or lease your data.
