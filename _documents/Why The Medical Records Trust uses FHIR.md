## 1. FHIR in a Nutshell

Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) is the internationally recognised standard for structuring and exchanging health information. It organises data into small, well-defined “resources” (for example, Patient, Observation, or MedicationRequest) and moves them through secure web-based interfaces. NHS England has placed FHIR at the heart of its interoperability strategy because it shortens integration times and supports safer, more consistent care.

## 2. What NHS Policy Says

Information Standard **DAPB4020** gives legal force to the use of UK FHIR Core R4 profiles whenever data is shared across health and adult social-care organisations in England.

All new national specifications and APIs published by NHS England are written in FHIR, ensuring that information can flow between systems with minimal conversion.

## 3. Why Exchange Is Still Challenging in Day-to-Day Practice

Many trusts and GP practices rely on large, proprietary electronic-patient-record systems. Each supplier stores data in its own database structure and often provides interfaces that differ from those of other vendors. These differences can slow down information-sharing and make routine tasks—such as moving a patient’s notes from hospital to GP—more complex than necessary. Subtle though it is, this situation can leave organisations feeling tied to a particular system, even when national standards such as FHIR are available.

## 4. How the Trust Addresses the Problem

The Medical Records Trust keeps every record exclusively in UK FHIR Core format. That single, consistent structure provides three clear benefits:

| Benefit              | What it means in practice                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consistency**      | Clinical notes, laboratory results and referral letters are stored in one recognised format. |
| **Controlled access**| You—and the people you nominate—use a secure FHIR interface to view or share information; consent can be granted or withdrawn at any time. |
| **Straightforward integration** | A GP surgery or hospital can call the Trust’s FHIR endpoint with your NHS number and import the data directly into its own system, without bespoke conversion work. |

Because the Trust’s database already conforms to the same specification that NHS England expects, new connections can be established quickly and reliably.

## 5. What This Means for Patients, Clinicians and Developers

- **Patients** – Your information is held once, in a recognised format, ready to accompany you wherever you receive care.
- **Clinicians** – Authorised staff retrieve accurate, up-to-date details in seconds, reducing repetitive data entry.
- **Developers and researchers** – Services can be built against an open, well-documented standard rather than a patchwork of individual database formats.

> **Key Benefit:** By mandating FHIR, The Medical Records Trust aligns with NHS policy and removes many of the practical barriers created by varied proprietary systems. The result is a record that is consistent, portable and—most importantly—under your control.
