# How the Medical Records Trust Collects Your NHS Records

We help you get your NHS health records safely. Here’s how it works:

## 1. We Ask You for Some Details

We need some information to find your records:

- **Your name, address, and birthday** – so we know it’s really you.
- **A photo ID and a letter with your address** – like a passport or a bill, to check your identity.
- **Where you have had care** – for example, which doctor or hospital you have visited.
- **Old addresses** – if you have moved, this helps us find all your records.

You can send us this information using our safe online forms.

## 2. You Give Us Permission

You sign a form to say it’s okay for us to collect your records.  
This form only lasts for a short time and says we must keep your information safe.

## 3. We Ask Your Doctors and Hospitals for Your Records

- We send a request to every doctor, hospital, or clinic you tell us about.
- We show them your ID and your permission.
- When they send us your records, we put them all together in one safe place.
- You can see which records have arrived and which are still coming.

## 4. You Can See and Use Your Records

When we have all your records, you can:

- Look at them online in your own safe account.
- Download them or share them with your doctor or family.
- Tell us if something looks wrong.

## 5. You Decide What Happens Next

You are always in control. You can:

- **Keep your records with us:**  
  We keep them safe and private.

- **Delete everything:**  
  You can ask us to erase all your records. We will do this and let you know when it’s done.

- **Stop new searches:**  
  You can tell us to stop asking for more records at any time.

If you ask us to delete your records, we do it within 14 days and cannot get them back.

## Sometimes Your Doctor May Check With You

To keep you safe, your GP or hospital might call, text, or write to you.  
They want to make sure you really asked us to get your records.  
They might ask you some simple questions, like your birthday or about the request.

If you get a message like this, please reply quickly.  
If you are not sure, you can ask us or your doctor for help.

## Remember

- **You are in charge.** We never get or share your records unless you say so.
- **Your records are safe.** We use NHS rules and keep everything private.
- **You can leave any time.** You can ask us to delete your records whenever you want.
