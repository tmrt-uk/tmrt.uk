# Document Format Guide

This guide explains how to structure and format healthcare technology documents for the Darwinist collection using Jekyll markdown.

---

## YAML Front Matter

Every document must begin with YAML front matter enclosed in triple dashes (`---`). This metadata controls how Jekyll processes and displays the document:

```yaml
---
layout: document
title: "Primary Document Title"
subtitle: "Explanatory subtitle"
date: 2025-06-01
author: "Darwinist Team"
tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Tag3"]
category: "Category Name"
featured: true
toc: true
hidden: false
excerpt: "Brief summary..."
---
```

**YAML Field Guidelines:**
- **title:** Use title case, be specific and descriptive
- **subtitle:** Explain the document's purpose or scope
- **tags:** Include 3-7 relevant keywords (healthcare tech, product names, standards)
- **category:** Use consistent categories like "Healthcare Technology", "Medical AI Solutions", "Healthcare Infrastructure"
- **excerpt:** Write a compelling 1-2 sentence summary highlighting key benefits, metrics, or unique value

---

## Markdown Heading Structure

Use ATX-style headings with proper hierarchy:

- `#` Main Title (H1) ‚Äì Use sparingly, mainly for document title
- `##` Major Section (H2) ‚Äì Primary content divisions
- `###` Subsection (H3) ‚Äì Secondary topics
- `####` Details (H4) ‚Äì Specific points
- `#####` Minor Points (H5) ‚Äì Rarely used
- `######` Smallest (H6) ‚Äì Avoid if possible

**Heading Best Practices:**
- Start with H2 for main content sections (H1 reserved for document title)
- Maintain logical hierarchy (don't skip levels)
- Use descriptive, scannable headings
- Include keywords relevant to healthcare/technology context

---

## Content Formatting

**Emphasis and Strong Text**
- *Italics for emphasis*
- **Bold for strong importance**
- ***Bold and italic for critical points***

**Lists**
- Use unordered lists for features, benefits, and capabilities:
  - Primary point
  - Secondary point
    - Nested sub-point
    - Another sub-point
- Use ordered lists for processes, steps, and phases:
  1. First step
  2. Second step
  3. Third step

**Code and Technical Elements**
- Use `inline code` for technical terms, file names, and commands.
- Use code blocks for longer technical content, configurations, or examples.

**Links**
- [External link text](https://example.com)
- [This AI Spec Document]({% link _documents/AI spec.md %})

**Blockquotes**
- Use for important quotes, key statistics, or highlighted information:
  > This is a blockquote for emphasis.

---

## Document Structure Pattern

Most healthcare technology documents follow this structure:

- **Executive Summary or Overview:**  
  Brief introduction explaining what the technology/solution does and its primary value proposition.

- **Key Features/Capabilities:**  
  - List main functionalities as bullet points.
  - Use numbered lists for processes.
  - Use clear headings for comparisons.

- **Technical Specifications:**  
  - System requirements
  - Integration capabilities
  - Standards compliance
  - Architecture details

- **Use Cases/Applications:**  
  - Real-world scenarios where the solution provides value.
  - Organize by healthcare setting, clinical specialty, or workflow type.

- **Benefits/Outcomes:**  
  - List quantified results, metrics, and qualitative improvements.
  - Include clinical outcomes, operational efficiency, cost savings, and user satisfaction.

- **Implementation/Deployment:**  
  - Setup requirements
  - Integration process
  - Training needs
  - Support available

- **Compliance/Security:**  
  - Regulatory certifications
  - Data protection measures
  - Healthcare standards compliance
  - Audit capabilities

- **Conclusion:**  
  - Summary of key value propositions and call to action.

---

## Writing Style Guidelines

**Tone and Voice**
- Professional but accessible: Avoid overly technical jargon without explanation.
- Confident and authoritative: Present information as factual and well-researched.
- Solution-focused: Emphasize benefits and outcomes for healthcare organizations.
- UK healthcare context: Reference NHS, NICE, CQC, and UK regulations where relevant.

**Technical Writing Best Practices**
- Define acronyms on first use: "Electronic Health Record (EHR)"
- Use active voice when possible.
- Include specific metrics and quantified benefits.
- Provide context for technical capabilities (why they matter clinically).
- Use consistent terminology throughout.

**Healthcare-Specific Considerations**
- Reference relevant UK healthcare standards (HL7 FHIR, DICOM, etc.)
- Include regulatory compliance information (CE marking, MHRA approval, etc.)
- Mention integration with common NHS systems.
- Address clinical workflow implications.
- Consider different user types (clinicians, IT staff, administrators).

## Special Formatting Elements

**Callout Boxes (using blockquotes with formatting)**
> **Key Benefit:** This solution reduces diagnostic time by 70% while improving accuracy.

**Feature Lists with Icons**
- ‚úÖ **FHIR Compliant:** Native support for healthcare interoperability standards
- ‚ùå **Legacy Compatible:** Works with existing PACS and HIS systems
- üîí **Secure:** End-to-end encryption and GDPR compliance

**Comparison Points**
- Instead of tables, use clear bullet points or headings to compare features, capabilities, or approaches.

---

## Common Document Categories

- "Healthcare Technology": General health IT solutions
- "Medical AI Solutions": AI-powered diagnostic and clinical tools
- "Healthcare Infrastructure": Core systems like PACS, imaging networks
- "Healthcare Standards": Documentation about FHIR, DICOM, HL7
- "Healthcare Policy": Analysis of regulations, procurement, strategy
- "Medical Imaging Solutions": Radiology and imaging-specific tools
- "Healthcare Education": Training and certification frameworks

---

## SEO and Discoverability

- Include relevant keywords naturally in headings and content.
- Use descriptive link text.
- Structure content for scanning (headings, lists, blockquotes).
- Include quantified benefits and outcomes.
- Reference popular healthcare technology terms and standards.

---

## File Naming Convention

Files should use descriptive names with spaces and proper capitalization, for example:
- `Product Name Technical Brief.md`
- `Healthcare Standard Implementation Guide.md`
- `Clinical AI Solution Overview.md`
