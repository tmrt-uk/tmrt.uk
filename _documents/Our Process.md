# How the Medical Records Trust Collects Your NHS Records on Your Behalf

We follow a straightforward, step-by-step process designed to protect your privacy and keep you in control.

## 1. Gather the Details We Need from You

**We ask for:**

- **Full name, current address, and date of birth:**  
  To match you accurately to the NHS Spine and other provider systems.

- **Photo identification (e.g. passport, driving licence) and proof of address (e.g. recent utility bill):**  
  To meet NHS identity-verification guidance and confirm we are acting for the right person.

- **List of where you have received care:**  
  This can be as simple as “saw GP in Gateshead” or as detailed as “admitted to X Hospital for heart-bypass surgery, 2018”. It helps us pinpoint which hospitals, GP practices or clinics hold records about you.

- **Previous UK addresses:**  
  Some records are indexed by historic address; providing these avoids missed matches.

We supply secure online forms for each item and can accept scanned documents or verified digital ID services.

## 2. You Authorise Us to Act on Your Behalf

You sign a single, time-limited authority that allows the Trust to request copies of your health records from the named providers. The authority:

- Cites the UK GDPR right of access (subject-access request)
- Specifies that data are to be supplied in UK FHIR Core format wherever possible

## 3. We Contact Each Provider and Retrieve the Records

- **Requests issued:**  
  We submit a subject-access request to every GP surgery, hospital or clinic on your list, including copies of your ID.

- **Data received:**  
  Providers send the records back to us; if they are not already in FHIR we convert them to the standard.

- **Progress updates:**  
  You can check a dashboard showing which requests are complete and which are still pending. Turn-round times vary: GP records often arrive within a month; older hospital archives may take longer.

## 4. You Review and Manage Your Consolidated Record

Once all responses are in, we present your complete record through a secure portal and a UK FHIR Core API.

You can download, share with a nominated clinician or family member, or raise queries if something looks incorrect.

## 5. Your Ongoing Choices

- **Keep your record with us:**  
  We store it securely in encrypted UK data centres, with audit logs and role-based access controls.

- **Delete everything:**  
  Select “Delete my record” in the portal. We erase all data we hold for you and send confirmation.

- **Pause or stop new searches:**  
  You can cancel outstanding requests at any time; we will not contact additional providers.

_Deletion requests are processed within 14 days and are irreversible._

## Important – Your GP (or Another Provider) May Verify Your Request

To protect patient confidentiality, many GP practices and hospitals perform an extra identity-check before they release records. After we submit your authorised request:

- Your GP surgery may phone, text or write to you to confirm that you have genuinely asked the Medical Records Trust to collect your notes.
- They might ask simple questions—e.g. your date of birth or details of the request letter—to be sure the enquiry is legitimate.
- Some practices will ask you to sign a short consent form or reply to a secure NHS email.

> **Please respond promptly; it prevents delays and shows the provider that you remain in control of the process.**

If anything looks unclear, contact us or your surgery directly. We can re-issue documentation, and you can cancel or pause the request at any time.

## Key Points to Remember

- **You remain in charge** – we never contact a provider or share data unless you have authorised it.
- **Everything uses recognised NHS standards** – data are stored exclusively in UK FHIR Core format, so any GP or hospital can read them easily.
- **No long-term commitment** – you may leave, delete or return at any time, and there is no fee for removing your data.
